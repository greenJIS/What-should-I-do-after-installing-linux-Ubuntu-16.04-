# What-should-I-do-after-installing-linux-Ubuntu-16.04-
After crushing my PC several times, I have to install Operating System (Ubuntu) in my PC along with previous all Softwares. So I decided to write down all links or commands in somewhere and plan to make a script that does all thing with a single piece of Code.
PS about crush: I always make a mess in my PC ;)
